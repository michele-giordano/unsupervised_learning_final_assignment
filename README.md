# Unsupervised Image Clustering with PCA, NMF, Autoencoder and DEC
This is a lightweight jupiter notebook of my Unsupervised Image Clustering project based on PCA, NMF, Autoencoder and DEC.

## Overview
This repository contains a **lightweight version** of my unsupervised image clustering project.  
It provides a clear, high-level view of the methodology, the structure of the code, and the main results, without including the heavy dataset and trained models.

The project explores a progression of unsupervised representation-learning techniques:  
PCA → NMF → Autoencoder → Fine-Tuned DEC.  
All experiments were conducted on a custom dataset of natural images created specifically for this assignment. The dataset is **not included** in this repository.

## Notebook
The notebook in this repository:

- preserves the original explanatory Markdown text,  
- shows the full workflow conceptually,  
- replaces all code outputs with **static images**,  
- removes all training logic, datasets, models, and hyperparameters.

This ensures transparency for reviewers while preventing any reproduction or misuse of the original work.

---

## What Is Not Included
To comply with the course rubric, respect the Honor Code and prevent academic plagiarism, the following items are **intentionally excluded**:

- dataset (images and metadata)
- trained model files and checkpoints
- full training scripts
- hyperparameter configurations
- intermediate logs and metrics 
- Android APK or assets
- any material enabling direct reuse of the project

---

## Intended Purpose
This repository is intended **exclusively** for:

- course evaluation,  
- peer review,  
- and professional portfolio visibility.

It allows readers to understand the methodology and architecture, while protecting the integrity of the original implementation.

---

## Environment
The original project used Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, and common scientific libraries.  
A minimal `requirements.txt` is included **for reference only**.

---

## Data Access
The dataset used in this project was manually generated for the assignment.  
It is not included in this repository and is not required for peer review.
